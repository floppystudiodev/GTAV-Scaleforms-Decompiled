Injecting yourself with botulism or sewing your forehead to the back of your skull is not the answer. We’re historians and scientists, not barbarians. The secret is formaldehyde. Remember that fetal pig from science class? How soft and unblemished its skin was? How it floated in that jar on the shelf, forever frozen in the perfection of youth, until you hacked it apart in 7th Grade? That could be you.Formaldehyde is all around us. It occurs naturally in our bodies, the air we breathe, diet sodas and cigarettes. It’s nature’s preservative. &nbsp;Why wait until post mortem to look good?

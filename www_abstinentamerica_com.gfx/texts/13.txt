Together we can make all those dreams come true. You never have to wake up again, saying, "What did I do last night?" and then roll over to see a smiling fatso with a mole on her / his face that has hairs growing out of it.Why do we need alcohol anyway? To lower inhibitions, reduce anxiety, hide from life’s problems and improve sexual confidence?  Nowadays, we now have prescription medication for all those things. Alcohol is already banned in places like Iran, the Southern counties of the Deep South and most schools and nurseries, and they’re all better places for it.

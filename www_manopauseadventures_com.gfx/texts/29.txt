You can buy fitness wear that makes it look like you climb mountains. Take your Age Rage to the next level.Why have an affair when you can have an orgy in a Lebanese bathhouse?Why do cocaine when you can hallucinate on Ayuhuasca for 5 days in the Ecuadorian rainforest?Why get a tattoo when you can get a prison vasectomy in Eritrea?Manopause Adventures specializes in over-priced extreme travel adventure experiences for men in their 40s and 50s desperate to assert their fading virility and take revenge on the young by going on trips they can&apos;t afford.Nothing impresses work colleagues and younger women more than a balding middle-aged man spending $20,000 to nearly kill himself in a far-flung corner of the third world.

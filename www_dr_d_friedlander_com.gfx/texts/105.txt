You have a distorted perception of reality. Why would you play word games when you are in serious mental distress?  Do you take anything seriously? God, it’s a wonder you haven’t stuck a knife in your head. I’m sensing a lot of chronic guilt, vanity, self-blame, and violent urges that can be alleviated with the help of a media savvy therapist. You’re in a dangerous state of denial and your emotional health is at serious risk. You’re a time bomb. My advice is to seek professional intervention from Dr Friedlander as soon as possible, and to take advantage of our limited special bulk-buy treatment packages. Being healthy costs money. And I accept credit cards. Dr. Isiah Friedlander

Dr. Friedlander is a psychotherapist, media personality, secular Buddhist and keen model boat enthusiast. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing from ULSA in 1984 and Doctorate Degree in Psychology in 1986 from a distance learning institution that no longer exists. He has spent a lot of time travelling in Asia.  His PhD thesis was entitled "Self-dom Seen: Over-regard in the Under-world", which has been widely praised for exposing the culture of narcissism in the ganglands of 1980s San Andreas and widely criticized for its overuse of hyphens. He is a leading authority in the field of Sociopathic Personality Disorder and has treated a large number of wealthy, damaged celebrities and career criminals whom he can't name for reasons of Hippocratic oath and/or personal safety. He has been through a lot of therapy himself.  His propensity for excessive use of people’s first names, affirmative nods, patronizing knee pats, affect mirroring and vivid metaphors have made him one of the most respected and in-demand therapists working in Los Santos today.He did not write this copy.

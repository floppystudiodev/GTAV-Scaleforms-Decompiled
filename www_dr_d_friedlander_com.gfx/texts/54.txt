Dr. Friedlander is available for speaking engagements, media appearances and sexual surrogate therapy. What better way to liven up your real estate convention, weekend retreat, or spiritual meeting than to hire a psychotherapist to speak for 2 hours?To share is to heal, which is why Dr. Friedlander is committed to educating the public about the importance of emotional health. As a student, Dr. Friedlander was a regular contributor to the hospital radio show "Debrief Encounters" at the Mount Zonah Medical Center, which he claims came very close to national syndication before it was canceled.  Dr. Friedlander is a gifted speaker whose unique blend of medical credentials, camera-ready charisma, pop-culture savvy and nonjudgmental, relatable demeanor is perfectly suited to television.  He should really get a regular slot on a national talk show soon. He has already been featured as a psychological pundit on a number of talk shows, reality shows and news segments, including Rehab Island and Weazel News. If there is a hurricane, boating accident, or a crane has fallen into a fast food store, and you want a talking head to provide conjecture, Dr. Friedlander is your man.

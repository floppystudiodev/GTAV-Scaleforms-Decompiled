Getting on the show is just the beginning of the trauma. When you’re surrounded by a bunch of other egomaniacs equally as desperate and fame-hungry as you, how do you stand out? You are going to need to GO BIG. Throw tantrums, chop off a finger - murder someone! You’re famous!The trick is to be yourself, but the worst version of yourself you can possibly be. Give in to all your base instincts. Get drunk. Punch women. Who cares? Viewers want to not feel quite so bad about their own failures and dysfunctional lives. Rest assured - no matter how low you go, the producer of the show will still be a more despicable, morally bankrupt person than you. Blow him and see.

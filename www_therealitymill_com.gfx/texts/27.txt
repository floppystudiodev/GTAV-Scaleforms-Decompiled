As soon as your face is somewhat recognizable, you need to go after every cent you can. Product endorsements, car dealership ribbon cuttings, mid-end escort work, birthday parties, tell-all tabloid news articles, porno shoots. Drag out your 15 minutes of fame for as long as possible, because in a couple of years you’ll be a maniacally-depressed pill addict waiting tables in your dead-end home town, where everyone will hate you even more than they did before. &nbsp;If you’re really lucky, you might even be able to ride the reality bandwagon all the way to your own spinoff show.We’ll make you a star. Just remember, whatever you do on TV isn’t the real you. Build a double personality and it will help you deal with the psychological drama of a business fueled by drugs, egos and ratings. &nbsp;Welcome!

This is the big one. You need to sleep with several people in the course of a couple of days, so prudes need not apply. You will be having joyless sex with nasty, fake tanned, horrible human beings. &nbsp;Every person in Vinewood did something sexual to get to where they are today. It is how this business works. And if you are going to be on reality TV, you need to bring it strong. Be prepared to be debased, humiliated, treated like a piece of garbage and shit on, literally. Once you’ve been through that, you’ll not only get great ratings, you’ll be able to take anything life throws at you. So it’s a bit like college, only you get paid.

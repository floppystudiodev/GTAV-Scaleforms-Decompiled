One of Devin Weston’s first mentees, Slim starts the day off with a game of handball and a protein smoothie. Most of his deals are done in locker rooms. He grew up on the wrong side of the tracks – and has come to hate public transportation ever since. He credits Weston with saving him from a life behind bars, most recently in 2008 when he was accused of promoting junk mortgage-backed securities to elderly investors then shorting those same securities for massive profits before they defaulted. He was never found guilty. He is a true family man. He has a loving third wife and children.   If it wasn’t for his well deserved bonus, the Weston Alpha Fund would have been the top performing investment in the world last year.

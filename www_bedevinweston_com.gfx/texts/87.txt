Devin graduated magna cum laude in Theater & Musical Therapy from San Andreas Community College without attending a single lecture. He was destined to be a leader. A year later he was a millionaire.A self-taught financial genius with an amazing tolerance for risk, high-intensity cardio and Kombucha, he revolutionized the  hedge fund industry in the early 2000s by refusing to hedge at all.  Since 2004 he has literally bought and deliberately bankrupted more companies than he’s had hot dinners, though he has been on a raw food diet since 2009. One of the world’s greatest living investors, the odds on him becoming president one day are 3:1.  But he’d never take a bet that safe.

As much as anything, I’m a teacher. I made my first million when I was 23 and a year out of college. I spent it in a week. A million is nothing. I drop that on a diving watch. My ex-wife cost me $135 million and that was cheap at the price. A million will buy you a 3-bedroom house, a midsize sedan and maybe a week in Turks and Caicos, if you’re lucky. Add a zero, then we can talk. I go in hard, I get out fast, I spin you around and I do it again, leaving you confused and spent. Investments, women, apocalyptic yoga, meditation - it doesn’t matter - that’s how I do it 24/7 on every level. That’s enlightenment. I’m a free thinker, but I’m also very spiritual. I own two ashrams, a beach house and I really care about the environment. You’ve got to stay ahead of the game to make your own rules. As soon as YOU know about it, I’m already gone. A shadow. A ninja. A ghost. I’m the most famous person you’ve never heard of. I’m a killer but I also care. I got in early on the Acai Berry and walked away with 9 figures. I rode the bull till it split in 1997 and fleeced the bear till it bled in 2001. When I took a volcano-kite surfing trip to Nicaragua in 2007 without closing out my positions, I was so highly-leveraged that I crashed the market. They’ll tell you it was the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it was me. I’ve made so much money it bores me. Anyone can do it. All it takes is the right attitude, lifestyle choices and a big pair of balls, along with a massive heart and a great and positive outlook on life. I used to buy $250,000 sports cars and crash them at high speed as a joke. Now, I help indigenous farmers, surf for a couple of hours and then make a few million shorting hydro carbons.

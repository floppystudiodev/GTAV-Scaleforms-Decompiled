Do you want to know why Los Santos is full of shitty films and shitty screenwriters who never sell screenplays? It&apos;s not just delusion, lack of talent and an unwillingness to perform sexual favors on coked-up old men. It&apos;s because they don&apos;t understand what movie studios are looking for.Only a few hundred movies get made each year now, and 99% of those are sequels, remakes and adaptations because production companies have turned into pussies who are too scared to take risks any more. It&apos;s never been harder to sell a spec script in Vinewood, but it is possible. You just have to understand the formula. And it is a formula. It&apos;s one of the main reasons all originality and creativity has been sucked out of the movie industry over the last 30 years. Movie execs are too busy thinking about merchandizing, product placement and banging the intern to process more than a sentence at a time. And they like what they already know. You just have to think of it as writing by numbers. We know the code - whether it&apos;s an action movie or an idiotic romantic comedy, we know the buttons to push and when.

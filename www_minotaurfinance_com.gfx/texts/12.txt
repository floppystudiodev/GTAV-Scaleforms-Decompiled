Minotaur Finance is a full-service real estate management firm. We are recognized as a leader in the Los Santos residential management industry for almost 20 years. That is, when we see other people at trade shows and cocktail parties, they recognize us. Sometimes we sleep with their wives. Just because. We can customize our services to manage any portfolio of property - from the beat down crack house to a 12,000 square foot beach house. We are about “excellence in management” and “putting things in quotes for emphasis.” We are world leaders in “buzz terms.” Our clients have come to expect our standard of excellence, including: Commercial Leasing, Residential Brokerage and Sales, Back Office Accounting Services, Back Door Deals, Under The Table Deals, Coyote Courier Services for Immigrant Employment, Risk Management, Making Things Go Away and Rental services. We stay in constant contact with our clients. Our office workers are all perky females under 30, still excited at life’s prospects rather than crushed into middle aged malaise like our competitors.

Is it your dream to be on television, with all of America glued to your every move? Think you’ve got a special talent that will make our judges shriek in awe? Well so does every other twit who appears on our show. But you’ll be different. You’re going to show the world.  Despite seeing people fail in shameful humiliation in front of millions, you know that won’t happen to you. Our show, unlike others, is open to any age and any talent. What’s funnier than seeing a five year-old trying to juggle axes and have one come down on her foot? Nothing. That’s what!

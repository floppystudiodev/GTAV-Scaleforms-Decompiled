After a string of pop hits in the 90s and some very productive stints in rehab in the early 2000s, Anita is a charmer who can't be stopped. Her perfume line is selling remarkably and she even released a set of workout clothes that are, as she says "all about the booo-tay!".Married and then divorced to 3 nearly top rappers, she loves men who can rhyme, sing, and shower her in bling.

Who needs to pay a ridiculous cable bill which mostly goes to greedy sports teams when you can watch it for free on the Internet and then use that money to buy a Face brand watch, case of Sprunk, keg of Logger, an Up ‘n’ Atom family meal, hardware supplies at Youtool, some refreshing Flow water, the new Drone, all on your fancy Fleeca card?Yes that is a long sentence. That’s what we are all about, great advertising and great syntax. Yeah!

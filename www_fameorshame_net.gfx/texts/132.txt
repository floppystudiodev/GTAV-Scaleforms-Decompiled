Whether it’s dogs humping humans, mimes setting themselves on fire, pointless cover versions of power ballads, finger puppets frigging each other, moms juggling dildos, one legged Irish dancers, the 'all new' and exciting Karin Dilettante, elephant wrestling, or dancing trannies, you don’t know what you’ll see next on Fame or Shame presented by Face, Sprunk, Logger, Up ‘n’ Atom, Youtool, Fleeca, Flow water, and The Drone.

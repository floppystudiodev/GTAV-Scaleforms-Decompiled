When the Internet began dismantling record companies, Hugh, like thousands of record executives, was thrown out of his cushy job of partying backstage with celebrities, doing drugs, banging hot young women, and making 90% of the profits on the back of everyone else's hard work.  After reading the Origin of Species one day, he founded the British version of Fame or Shame and set up a record company that all contestants were obliged to sign to in order to compete.  The recent Internet video of Harrison drunk at an after-party speaking in an upper Midwest accent is, according to Hugh, a bit of a joke he was playing on everyone. "I'm from England. I wouldn't be from a place as pitiful as the Midwest. That's where Lazlow's from - but I love America. I love the can-do spirit and the total lack of shame. Fan-bloody-tastic" he remarked in a statement.

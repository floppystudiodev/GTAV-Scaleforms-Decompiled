The man that never sits still, not in any way due to OCD and ADHD, is back to host another season of Fame or Shame. A humble, eloquent, virile philanthropist, Lazlow shuns the limelight. That being said, as a successful, multifaceted entertainer, he has worked in radio across America. He's worked in all formats, from Rock to Pop to Talk.  His dream since bursting onto the radio dial as a teen in the 1980s was to take it to the next level and be on television. He says he has never had cosmetic surgery, but "never say never". He's also been a successful reader since the age of 13.Recently voted the most handsome man in America by a major online poll, a lot of top movie producers are currently competing to cast Lazlow in a major motion picture. He's also written a book which (after published) will probably win a lot of serious awards.He's available for a lot of endorsement opportunities, even medical ones, but he doesn't use Mollis. Ever. Not that he's being judgmental. Or a Eunuch. In fact, according to several groupie websites he showed us, he has a 'significant' penis.

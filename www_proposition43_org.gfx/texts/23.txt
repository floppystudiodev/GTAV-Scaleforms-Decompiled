Dad is drinking too much. Mom is looking longingly at the neighbor&apos;s teenage son. The children are neglected. Jimmyâ€™s a psychopath. Mary Lou wants to shake it for kicks. We are told to marry our childhood sweetheart, knock her up since she&apos;s the only girl you ever slept with, and then live a life of quiet agony, gritting your teeth as you watch her thighs widen and her breasts turn to turnips. With moms and dads that are fighting, sexless and miserable, it&apos;s little wonder that so many American children are failing school. Even Europeans are now better than us at lots of things. America was once a superpower, but now places like Asia and other places not like Asia have stolen our thunder.

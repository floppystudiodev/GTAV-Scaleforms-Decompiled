Who says a family has to be a man and woman of the same race repressing their biological children with religious guilt? Why can’t a family be a single woman and two gay children, or two Hindu men and a Cambodian baby, or a multi-faith group of friends with benefits living in a converted railroad car selling their composted waste at farmer’s markets? It can and it must! We’re not saying ‘being different is the right way’, we’re saying ‘being different is the only way, that way we’ll all be the same again.” History shows it’s only by outright banning something that we can make progress, so vote Proposition 43 and ban nuclear families.

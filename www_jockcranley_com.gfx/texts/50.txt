If you&apos;re over the age of 40, you probably remember me from the hit 1980s television show "Stunt Double" where my character performed amazing stunts while solving crimes that always happened inexplicably near the movie set in the show. &nbsp;I died for a living on TV. It was a life of leading ladies and danger. But now my leading lady is lady liberty, the danger is what liberals are doing to this country, and I want to be your Governor.

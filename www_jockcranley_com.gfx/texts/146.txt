Congratulations true American. Traditional family values, free-market capitalism, unregulated gun ownership, no taxes and cosmetic surgery are the foundations on which our great nation was built. You work hard and don&apos;t want your money wasted on welfare, public education, healthcare and unisex restrooms for freeloading hippies, foreigners and sexual deviants. You talk loudly, you high five, you eat red meat and play air guitar.

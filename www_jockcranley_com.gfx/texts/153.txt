You have a difficult time making up your mind, and there&apos;s nothing worse than a fence-sitter who&apos;s ready to play either field. That&apos;s for bisexuals. Modern American politics are built on a two-party system - one straight, the other gay. You probably don&apos;t even use sports metaphors. At least have the balls to admit you&apos;re a sissy liberal - then have an operation to remove those balls so you can marry a female fire-juggler and live on welfare for the rest of your pathetic life.

Gold is for Aztecs. Stock is for idiots living the tech dream. Real Estate? Give me a break. The only thing America manufactures any more is fear – and brother I am making a bundle of it.Insane government spending, out-of-control money printing, hyperinflation, fiscal deficit, trillions of dollars of national debt. These aren’t just terms I found on the internet. I found more. This is the beginning of the end. All ends have a beginning, a halftime, and an end, and you better spend halftime taking a piss and looking in the mirror and saying “I gotta sober up. I gotta do something. This is all going to hell” If I had a hundred dollars for every time I heard somebody say “It won’t happen to me”, I’d still be nowhere near as rich as I am now but I’d have plenty of money. Because I acted early and took the necessary steps to protect myself and my family from financial ruin.

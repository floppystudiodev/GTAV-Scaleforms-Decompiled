To protect and maximize the value of your portfolio, no withdrawals are permitted until after the economy has collapsed AND you have recruited 20 new participants to the scheme.  The more investments at the bottom, the bigger the returns at the top. That’s economics! A pyramid – like the Egyptians. How do you think they built that my friend? And it’s still here today, that‘s how I designed my plan.See you on the other side!Warmly,Bill Binder.

Most cleanses ease you in - not the POW Cleanse. It takes you by surprise, just like those insurgents took me. Eat nothing all day, and then at the end drink some dirty water out of a tin cup. It MUST be really dirty - full of bacteria and microbes that help you cleanse. If you cannot find some local stagnant water in a ditch near a factory, the package includes some tap water from Bangladesh that should do the trick.

Grass and Grasshoppers.  You are only allowed to eat raw grass, or bugs like grasshoppers if you can catch them.  We recommend mowing the yard on Day 5 and collecting the lawn clippings and free protein (bugs) in a trash bag so you can dip into it whenever you feel yourself getting hungry.  Note - nightly laxatives during this stage are good because you actually release toxins while sleeping, rather than spending the day on the toilet.  When you awake, collect your soiled sheets and burn them - ritualistic fires are part of the cleanse.

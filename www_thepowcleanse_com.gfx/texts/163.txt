Freedom! The sound of a helicopter, some explosions that shake everything, the excited yelling of your captors is heard, especially the big one with the lazy eye who hit you more than the others.  Then quiet, and a marine comes through the door and rescues you. Thatâ€™s how it will feel when you emerge from your sweaty haze to the real world.

Asshole Armageddon - thanks to the bacteria in the water you will be cleansing all through the night and next day.  Just keep telling yourself that dysentery is nature’s detox.  It’s best if you take this day off of work and spend it in the heated room.  DON’T DRINK ANY WATER!  You must purge everything from your system.  I didn’t get any water on Day 2, you don’t either.  Stay strong - it will all be worth it in the end.  The POW Cleanse doesn’t just address your superficial body image issues.  It digs deep into your psyche.  After 18 straight hours of defecating blood and mucus, you won’t just look different; you’ll look at yourself differently.

Drink your own urine - This sounds ridiculous but it works. It worked for me. If you have to, freeze it and make a pee smoothie or snow cone. Eskimos say “Never drink yellow snow” - that’s why they’re mostly fat. You’ll be so thirsty after Day 2, it will feel like your only hope for survival.  You might start to notice some fever, hallucinations or hair loss at this stage.  Don’t mistake these for signs of bodily distress - it just means the cleanse is working its magic. Remember, pain is just weakness leaving the body. And also remember, homilies are great when it comes to weight loss.

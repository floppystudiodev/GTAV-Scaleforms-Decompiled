Are you out of work?Struggling to make ends meet?Do you have debts piling up?Why not do some temp work?This isn&apos;t stuffing envelopes or answering phones for some cretin at an insurance company. This is high profile temp work.Temp work is better than a full time job. You could take a minimum wage job six days a week cleaning diarrhea off the Taco Bomb toilets, or you can start a new part-time career in the glamorous, lucrative world of international trade and import.

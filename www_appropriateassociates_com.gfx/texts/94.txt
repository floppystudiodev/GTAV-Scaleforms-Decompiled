Real relationships are hard to come by in Los Santos. &nbsp;In today’s disposable, online, always connected world, social media has cheapened the bond of friendship to the point of irrelevant pictures of breakfast and drunken crotch shots.It’s a well known fact that Americans are lonelier now than they’ve ever been. &nbsp;Getting a "friend" to show up on your Lifeinvader page is one thing but getting them to show up for a party or meaningful event in your life is a different challenge entirely. &nbsp;People just can’t be relied on anymore.

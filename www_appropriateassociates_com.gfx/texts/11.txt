Jasper is the triple threat: unconventionally good-looking, bi- slash gay and mixed-race. &nbsp;Even the most bigoted asshole will look cool and open-minded next to this 28-year-old, 140-pound blogger and fashion pioneer. &nbsp;He joined Appropriate Associates in 2011 to supplement the allowance he receives from his parents and because he loves to dance ironically and drink himself unconscious. &nbsp;He doesn’t work but talks a lot about starting his own food truck. &nbsp;He doesn’t own a TV but watches a lot of pirated TV on his smartphone. &nbsp;He plays in a nu-folk band, wears an over-sized beanie even in the height of summer, and claims to have moved to Mirror Park before it sold out. &nbsp;Of course, he hates hipsters.

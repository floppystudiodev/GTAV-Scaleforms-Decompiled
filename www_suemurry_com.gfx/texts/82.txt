How do you sleep at night? Congratulations on your record-breaking bonus. Congratulations on Globe Oil’s record-breaking profits. Congratulations on the record-breaking gas prices. Are you enjoying the billions in taxpayer subsidies?No, really, congratulations. That’s pretty impressive for an earth raping thief. &nbsp;&nbsp;Name one thing that is better because of the combustion engine. You can’t. Because of you the world is a polluted mess. Oil should be illegal. &nbsp;I refuse to live my life in subjugation to a criminal any longer. I am a proud resident of San Andreas and supporter of its future governor, Sue Murry, and I am joining the fight to make our state Combustion Engine Free by 2016. Thank you for getting me around all these years but, from today forward, I will be boycotting your product and traveling in a bus that runs on biofuel and French fry oil. I’ll never travel on anything dependent on oil (except for airplanes and the occasional taxi when really wasted).I vow to only eat organically farmed food that traveled by rickshaw to market. &nbsp;You can keep your blood money. You can keep your black gold. If religion wasn’t a lie and hell existed, you would burn in a fiery pit of oil for all eternity. &nbsp;Sincerely,The Vocal Minority.

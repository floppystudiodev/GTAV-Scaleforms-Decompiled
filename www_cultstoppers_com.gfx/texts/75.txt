Mr. Cris-without-an-H Formage. A failed actor and successful alcoholic who started a religion franchise as a last-ditch attempt to get himself in the limelight, and in the process deified himself as an alien god. A millionaire hundreds of times over, he now divides his time between high-priced speaking engagements, authoring books he hasnâ€™t written, partying with celebrities, and having sex with his young disciples. Not that time is an issue when you claim to be thousands of years old and immortal and that he has made women from sand.

When we first heard the stories of a remote rural hideout, daylight curfews, anti-technology vitriol and human sacrifice, we thought they might have been talking about our old cult. Then we remembered that they all skinned themselves alive and jumped into a vat of burning acid two years ago, in what we can only imagine was the final act of glorious martyrdom we’d been promised for so long.   We’d also assumed that "The Altruists" was an ironic name, until we heard that all its members are elderly and from a generation that pre-dated irony and personal responsibility. We’re told that they’re extremely secretive, extremely well-armed and extremely naked. And an old, armed nudist is never a good thing, especially when they’re rumored to be on some kind of ageist Jihad against the under 40s at the bequest of an alien called Lord Zapho who is coming to reclaim the earth.Or maybe they’re just senile?  If you have any intel on this cult, please contact us immediately.  We can’t find any former members who have dropped out, which is really worrying! We hear talking of a Master, of people disappearing and talk of this being the baby boomers last boom, but we don’t have much to go on.

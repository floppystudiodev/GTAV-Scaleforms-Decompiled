What if you had control over the lives of everyone you know? What if you had the power to be liked by people you haven’t even met? Lifeinvader makes you feel special and loved. It taps right into the God complex at the heart of all of us. It makes us a nation of lonely morons while convincing us we’re connecting with people!

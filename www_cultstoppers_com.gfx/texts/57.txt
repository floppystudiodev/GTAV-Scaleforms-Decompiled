Yep. Brother Adrian. Welsh tax accountant turned spiritual leader, poet and harnesser of human potential. A man who's made millions selling bullshit to millions. He even owns a radio station in Liberty City that plays trippy music while the DJ repeats CoM dogma. Brother Adrian is proof that people really will believe anything someone with an annoying British accent tells them.

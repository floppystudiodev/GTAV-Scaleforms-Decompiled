Children of the Mountain is the worst kind of cult: the self-help cult that only really exists online, like perverts. CoM claims to be a personal development community and the world leader in digital self-awareness training. They hide behind brochures and slogans and slick marketing. They use stupid feel-good jargon like “acknowledge your actuality” and “utilize your completeness”. They spend a lot of time and money trying to explain how they're not a cult. If you spend all your time screaming “I'm not gay!” then you probably are - trust us on that one.

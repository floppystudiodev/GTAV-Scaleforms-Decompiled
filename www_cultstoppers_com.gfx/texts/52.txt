Over a million people have been duped by their 4-stage “self-realization” course, which guarantees a new life of success, enlightenment and sex with strangers. All from a weekend seminar or online program.  And all for a hefty fee, of course, and with the caveat that you spend every waking minute hawking their products to your friends and family. Thousands of dollars later, and guess what?  Your life's still shit and you still haven't had blissful sexual congress with beautiful strangers.

The atheist movement community is about the most condescending, classist group of zealots you could ever have the misfortune to meet in the conference facilities of a 3-Star hotel. They’ve got it right, everyone else has got it wrong. They refuse to even acknowledge the possibility that any of their theories might be flawed. Wait, doesn’t that sound a bit like organized religion? Their religion is nothing and we’re all morons for thinking that something this complicated might actually have a creator!

Who is God? Why does he always need money? What is string theory? Why was I circumcised? Hello, my name is Dr. Dale Jenkins and this is a transcription of a lecture I never gave but would have done if someone important had asked. I apologize in advance for my smug writing style, but I’m surrounded by hairy morons. I’m a biologist, rationalist, writer, thinker, philosopher, visionary, birdwatcher, cartographer, product endorser, cave painter and proud atheist. My books have been translated into over 40 different languages, including some that are just people clicking. All that clicking. Do you know what that means? The South African bushmen of Botswana would do that when I was teaching their teenage sons gymnastics. I have hundreds of honorary degrees, but you could best describe me as a questioner.

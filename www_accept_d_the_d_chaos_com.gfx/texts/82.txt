To all my young, white middle-class fanboys desperately trying to cast off the shackles of their puritanical upbringings, I thank you for your support and urge you to buy a ticket for my upcoming speaking tour before they sell out. To all the faith-sufferers out there desperately trying to please some imaginary cloud-dweller in order to win a ticket to a fantasy land with gold streets and fields of lollypops and leprechauns, I urge you to open your eyes and see organized religion for what it really is. It’s pompous creepy men with beards trying to tell you about the universe. Unlike me, religion is full of condescending, zealous egomaniacs incapable of considering a point of view other than their own. Treating hypotheses as proven facts, pushing their opinions down people’s throats, telling you what you should and shouldn’t believe, resorting to increasingly desperate and radical rhetoric to convert you to their way of thinking. Let me assure you, you won’t find any of that in the atheist movement that I promote.

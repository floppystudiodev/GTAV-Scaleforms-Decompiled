I’m going to hire a bus, and tour the country, and you can join me at mass rallies where we’ll revel in the excitement that life is pointless. I’ll ride around the farms and countryside of America, proclaiming that there is no God over loudspeakers. And unwashed peasants will run barefoot out of their religious farmhouses and chase the bus, and we’ll slow for them, the dust blowing down the road, and they’ll join our movement, er, our non-movement movement. And then everyone will mate! With me! There’s plenty to go around! Let’s go on a journey right now. We’re out on the African Savanna over six hundred thousand years ago, and I lightly brush the tip of your chest with my opposable thumb. I’ve made a small fire to warm you.Mmmmmm. Evolution. Science.

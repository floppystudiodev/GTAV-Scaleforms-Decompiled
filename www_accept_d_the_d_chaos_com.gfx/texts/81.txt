What is the universe made of? Dark Energy – like the kind that you feel after you hold your breath for a long time. But I’m not here to talk about choking games. I’m here to tell you that atheism is the only rational way. It’s a new religion, but one that’s been around forever. And that’s the religion of only believing what certain people tell you. Religion is a crutch, but book tours promoting my books are like spiritual journeys. Only rational and proper and full of masturbating jokes. But that doesn’t make me a wanker! (Insert knowing look!)

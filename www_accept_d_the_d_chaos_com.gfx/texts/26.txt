Think of how fantastic life was when our early ancestors marched across Europe as the glaciers were melting, foraging in small bands; short, hairy creatures who worshiped the sun and the earth, made beds of reeds, preening each other and mating with close relatives, covered in bugs. Think of the first time a primate fashioned a tool and used it on a woman. And here we are today, with the most fantastic tool of primates and primordial shit slinging – the internet. Oh yes, we’re much smarter now. And that’s evolution. Just like in the movies.

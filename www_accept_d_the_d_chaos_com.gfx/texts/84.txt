If you need to follow someone, follow me. If you need to believe in something, believe in evolution, because it’s the best explanation we’ve come up with yet. And don’t start coming at me with questions about male nipples, or where the first living cell came from or how did the eye evolve, or why do we do altruistic things. I refuse to debate with idiots. &nbsp;You don’t need to understand all the scientific stuff. Just trust me - I don’t know everything, but I do know more than you. A lot more. Thanks for listening. Remember, there are thousands of stars in the sky, but many of them have already burned out, and you’re about to as well.

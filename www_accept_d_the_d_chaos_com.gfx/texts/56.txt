Well how do you know there’s gravity? You can’t see it unless you drop your pint! What keeps women from flying into the ceiling? Who wouldn’t rather believe there’s a magical old man in the sky who, in between horrific and unfair acts of cruelty and mass genocide, fulfills our dreams, keeps us safe, and wants us to wear horribly uncomfortable clothes on Sunday morning or be petrified of light switches or Halloween? Why does the creator hate vaginas so much? It&apos;s better to live in utter fear and hopelessness than to live a lie. And it’s better to place your blind faith in science you don’t fully understand than ancient fables you don’t fully understand. After all, scientists aren&apos;t creepy demagogues with weird perversions and deluded messiah complexes. Well, even if they are, they&apos;re right. Science never gets anything wrong. At all. After death. Then death. I understand it’s hard to accept the fact that human beings are nothing more than leathery bags of fat and farts descended from crawling fish mutants.It’s depressing to know that your existence is an irrelevant blink in the cosmic twilight, and that literally nobody will care that you existed 100 years from now. And that every woman you will ever sleep with or love doesn’t matter. Stop caring! It’s easy! Turn away from your loved ones and walk away! We’ll all be dead soon. What’s more depressing is to not have smug intellectual friends to commiserate the futility of the universe with! We can be those friends.

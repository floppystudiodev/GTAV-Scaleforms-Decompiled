Don’t believe everything you read. Especially fairy tales written in medieval times. Books are full of lies. And how boring are people that read the same book over and over? Sheesh! Pick up the Dragonbrain series of books for goodness sake! Don’t be so damn full of yourself. And as for Darwin? He was the biggest fraud of the lot.

Sadly many of our, ahem, cousins, haven’t evolved. They are around the world, of many different creeds and colors and, more worryingly, faiths, living a lie about where we came from. Our religion is reason – and we champion the cause of evolution. It might be a theory, but just like when you smell another man’s musk on your woman’s breast, you know what’s happened before, even if you didn’t witness it. Besides, evolution is rooted in science, and scientists are always right until proven wrong by the next generation of scientists with even bigger grants and worse sexual hang ups. Look at all the great things that science has created, from a little device that turns a city into glass, to DDT to penis pills. Science rocks! Who needs an invisible man when you have a million invisible friends on your phone? A phone that can take a picture of your penis and send it to a million people instantly. Science made that. And that means we know what we’re talking about. Still not convinced? Of course. More than a billion rednecks still believe the world was created by some mythological multi-armed elephant or superhero 5000 years ago. Individually, they’re harmless, incoherent drunks, but collectively they’re a terrifying force of nature. Unlike us – we are nature. &nbsp;

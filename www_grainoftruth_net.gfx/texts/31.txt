Some say that we sell ludicrously over-priced gourmet organic food marketed under the guise of social and environmental responsibility so that yuppies feel less guilty about spending $30 on some precut carrots sticks when half the world is starving. That’s not true. Food SHOULD be expensive. It’s what you put in your body.So pay as much for it as things you wear or drive. &nbsp;It’s much more important. &nbsp;

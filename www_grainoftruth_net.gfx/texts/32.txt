As soon as you enter The Grain of Truth parking lot - you’ll notice - these are people like me! Happy people emerging from hybrid automobiles clutching hemp shopping bags with jolly children. People that listen to public radio while drinking wine and love to discuss gay marriage and why conservatives are so mean. You may be upper middle class and guilt ridden, but only one thing really separates you from the unwashed blue collar heathens: food snobbery. The Grain of Truth reinforces your status as a cultured, sophisticated urbanite. When you see products that use the words “organic”, “natural”, “fair trade”, “macrobiotic”, “gluten-free”, “cruelty-free” or “farm-to-table” on the packaging, are you really going to quibble with price? &nbsp;What other store sells apples harvested by people in wheelchairs? Take your heart out and hand it over - it has the number 100 on it with a president’s face - now, don’t you feel better?

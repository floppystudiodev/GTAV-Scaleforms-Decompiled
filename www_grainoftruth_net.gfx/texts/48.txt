Please forgive the matted hair, face piercings, dirty fingernails and condescending attitude. Our young, progressive cashiers don’t just serve you, they judge you. If your basket doesn’t contain a varied healthy selection from all the major food groups, they’ll send you back into the aisles. If they see a mother feeding formula to a baby, they’ll throw her out. If you ask for a plastic shopping bag, they’ll spit in your face.

Food Stamps NOT accepted.If you are on welfare, you really shouldn’t be buying $30 a quart organic goats milk and artisanal cheeses. We can’t, however, stop you from digging through the dumpsters in back. &nbsp;We wholeheartedly support the freegan movement apart from when they annoy us, and we set private security on them.

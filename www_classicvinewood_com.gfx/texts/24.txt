This pirate film is noted for its exceptional gun battle scene in which live ammunition was mistakenly used. The propmaster went to prison, but not before the movie won scores of awards for some amazing acting that wasn’t really acting. Despite its heavy-handed attempts at morality lessons and a rewriting of Greek mythology (entirely lost on 99% of its audience), Curse of Triton remains a wildly-successful swashbuckling classic. It also introduced the first leading role for baseball star Ace Jones as legendary buccaneer Willie La Roche. An Irishman with a flair for French fashion, Willie pouts, winks, loots and plunders his way across the Bay of Biscay in lavish silk clothing and takes wenches in his signature way that eventually coined the term "Angry Pirate". In a tournament of libido, he battles his nemesis Gregorio, played by the elephantine strongman of the day, Mad Wayne Thunder. The finale includes the King of Spain, a harem, and a giant squid in a sensational sea battle that was filmed in Austin’s pool.

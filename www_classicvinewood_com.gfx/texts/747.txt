“It’s time to fight to the end. Again.”Directed by Barry Andrews, "Shoulder of Orion II" capitalized on the huge success of "Shoulder of Orion I" by rehashing the original more or less scene-for-scene. Plasma beams are switched for acid rays, lizard-aliens are switched for carnivorous plant-aliens (who luckily speak English), but the movie is essentially identical, just executed with slightly lower quality across the board. The multiracial crew of Warrocket 1 must save Planet Earth from extinction and deliver as many one-liners as possible doing it. The movie completely rips off the old radio show "Time Ranger" in that the crew of the ship can travel through time by masturbating. Like most crappy movies of the 1980s and 1990s, the passage of time has transformed it into a cult classic and nerds still congregate in dark theaters today to masturbate with the actors on screen during a 20-minute time travel space battle.

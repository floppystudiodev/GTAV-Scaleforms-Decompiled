Can you fall in love with the girl you crippled in a drunk driving accident?Rum Runner is the epic story of a gang of bootleggers smuggling booze down the West Coast from the Saint Lawrence Seaway in the early 1920s, and their leader Eddie Olson, who transforms from small-time Canadian country boy to one of the most powerful gangsters in Prohibition-era Los Santos. He falls in love with a girl called Beryl whom he crippled in a drunk driving accident and starts a relationship with her. The love scenes in the wheelchair rolling around the house are epic. However, after she finds out about all the blood on his hands, she gives him an ultimatum: her or the rum. So Eddie must choose between a life of booze, money and prostitutes or the love of a beautiful girl who canâ€™t feel anything from the waist down so he gets a lot of backdoor access, so to speak. A rival smuggler shoots her in the head and Eddie moves to Vice City, becoming an insurance agent with a fetish for girls in wheelchairs. Then he saves some sick children.

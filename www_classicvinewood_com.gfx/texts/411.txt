“In Happy Valley High, everyone is learning how to bake… and get baked.”The first of the great topless teen films. What happens when you combine high school with marijuana, unprotected sex and a soundtrack with every one of the rock legends of the day? Comedy gold, that’s what. A group orgy in chemistry class ensues after the teacher synthesizes a chemical that makes people take their clothes off. Unfortunately it’s unleashed in the teachers lounge too where 60-year-olds rip their clothes off and go at it. Laugh as groups of red-eyed kids in flared jeans and tie-dye t-shirts easily evade the clutches of farcically-inept local policemen. Laugh at the same jokes about nobody being able to find their locker and being really hungry. Laugh as bearded teachers groove with cheerleaders in the name of free love. They don’t make them like this anymore, because they’re not allowed to.

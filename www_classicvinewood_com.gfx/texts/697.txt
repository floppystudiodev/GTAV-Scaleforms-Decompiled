A gloriously cheesy action movie cult classic starring Al Di Napoli. Famed for its over-choreographed, homoerotic fight scenes and shameless promotion of right-wing values, "The Redeemer" doesn’t waste any time on character or plot development – it jumps right in.  When, for some unknown reason, an army of Arabs-disguised-as-aliens decides to begin their hostile takeover of America from a small Midwestern rural town, local track coach Drew Falcon has other ideas. Falcon’s muscular, shirtless look might be inappropriate for his day job at Narrowview High School but, when it comes to mowing down faceless terrorists, it fits the bill perfectly. Assisted by a cowardly deputy sheriff and the town drunk Lambert (who by a stroke of luck turns out to be an ex special forces operative), Falcon (who for reasons that aren’t explained spent much of his childhood in Asia learning multiple martial arts) saves the US of A and wins back the love of his estranged wife by killing hundreds of ethnic stereotypes with an impractically over-sized gun without reloading once.

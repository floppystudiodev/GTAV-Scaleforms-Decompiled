Remember a time when America still knew how to build things and win wars? A time before political correctness, when you could depict minorities any way you wanted? A time before CGI and special effects when, if you needed a monster, you made one yourself out of seaweed and egg boxes and fear? A time when you could smoke in the cinema and the commercials before movies were for folding bicycles and local restaurants? A time when leading women fainted at a manâ€™s slightest touch and leading men were leathery, strong-jawed lotharios who died in their forties from liver failure?  We do. Join us on a trip down memory lane. Everything looks good through the lens of nostalgia, even the 1980s.

Set in a sanitorium in the 1920s, a group of lunatics with tuberculosis break out and fight for womenâ€™s suffrage. They are then eaten by stray dogs, and we follow one runt of the pack as he is taken in by a woman with enormous breasts. One morning the dog is scared by her and accidently bites, giving her a fatal disease from which she dies. The dog then begins to talk in the movie and gives a long speech about how charity is cowardice and selfishness is a virtue.

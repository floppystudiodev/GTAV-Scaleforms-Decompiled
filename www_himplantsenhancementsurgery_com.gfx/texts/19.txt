Women aren’t the only ones with body image and Daddy issues any more. &nbsp;Get the male implants you need and finally become you. &nbsp;It’s not easy being a man in today’s world. &nbsp;As if there weren’t enough demands to be successful providers, fearless protectors, sensitive lovers, doting fathers and gourmet chefs, modern men are now expected to be as lean, muscled, tall and handsome as the waxed androgynous himbos their wives and girlfriends drool over in magazines, movies, and reality TV shows. &nbsp;Gone are the days when male grooming consisted of a good, long shit and a splash of cologne. &nbsp;Suddenly men are being judged by the same unrealistic standards as women!!It’s unfair but true. All around us are idealized images of airbrushed, perfectly-sculpted models, pop stars and actors with broad shoulders, narrow waists, washboard abs, perfect hair and packages the size of a Christmas turkey.The pressure for men to look good has never been greater. &nbsp;Starvation dieting, strong diet pills and steroids aren’t the only answer. Cosmetic surgery is the fastest, healthiest way to get cut, trim and chiseled.

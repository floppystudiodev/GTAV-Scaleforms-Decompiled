Q: &nbsp;I hear the locals will kidnap you, hold you hostage for 10 years, then leave you for dead at the side of the road once your asshole has prolapsed beyond usability. &nbsp;A: &nbsp;An urban myth. That hasn’t happened in months.Q: &nbsp;I watched a documentary about how years of botulism poisoning and pesticide run-off have destroyed the local wildlife.Is this true? &nbsp;A: &nbsp;Everybody wants to make documentaries about the Alamo Sea these days. It’s almost all lies. The local area is still home to a huge diversity of unique wildlife in an ever-changing state of mutation, including the Greater Spotted Three-faced Pelican, the Featherless WaterFowl and desert rats the size of pitbull terriers.It also offers some of the best and easiest fishing in the nation – they literally throw themselves onto the beach. &nbsp;Q: &nbsp;My husband and I are thinking of visiting the Alamo Sea in the fall. Are there any hotels?A: &nbsp;The local accommodation is basic but charming - mostly comprised of trailer parks, abandoned meth labs and the hulls of boats half-submerged in mud pits. It’s all part of the unique experience.

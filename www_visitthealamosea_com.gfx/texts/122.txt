Imagine the therapeutic powers of a resort with year-round triple-digit heat, the delicate aroma of sulfur in the air, the crunch of white fishbone sand beneath the feet, the warming sight of three generations of the same family sharing a bottle of hooch around an open fire... the Alamo Sea is a vacation guaranteed to stimulate all the senses. &nbsp;Don’t believe what you&apos;ve heard! The Alamo Sea is the new hot spot for hipsters, thrill-seekers and people ready to live on the edge. Why go to the ocean when you can go to a lake in the desert instead? Why travel halfway around the world for danger and adventure when it exists right here on your doorstep? As you stand a couple of hundred feet below sea level, the chocolate-brown water lapping at your feet, we promise you’ll never feel further from home. &nbsp;

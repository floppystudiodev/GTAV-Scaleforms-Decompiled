You know how every "Righteous Slaughter" game is the same, as are most other modern video games? That&apos;s why games aren&apos;t good any more. Well, me and my company want to re-make the classic game "Space Monkey", and get you to pay for it - then we’ll sell you a copy. We don’t yet own the rights to Space Monkey so we might call it something else like "Space Ape", or "Monkeys In Space", but it’ll be exactly like a good, old fashioned game, only really new and we’ll make all the money. Which is cool. If you give us lots of money, we’ll even pretend to listen to your ideas about development before copying old designs anyway! It’s the future and it’s cool. I might do a video soon.

Imagine if trees moved. Imagine a tree stuck in traffic. Artist Keith McKallker is doing just that - making the urban forest in the concrete jungle. By taking a tree and growing it out the sunroof of his car - he will make a statement about the future of our lives and the urban skyline. It is our plan and intention to have a tree growing out of every sunroof in Los Santos. By filling the passenger side from floorboard to seat with organic compost, Keith plants a tree that reaches 20 feet high out the sunroof. Trees are beautiful standing still, but even more beautiful doing 75 miles an hour. &nbsp;

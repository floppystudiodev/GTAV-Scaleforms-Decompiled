I want to climb Mount Chiliad and make a movie of it and I want you to pay for it. I know it’s not very high but I’ve never done anything like that before and I realized you can just get other people to pay for everything now. So pay for this. You owe me. And if you don’t, you totally suck balls and I’ll probably become a serial killer or a lawyer.

My wife is pretty fat (trust me, it’s not as bad as people say) and LOVES chocolate, she often falls asleep eating chocolate on the couch. Our Boston Terrier "Mr Spittle" got really sick and died from eating it from between her breasts - which he had seen me do so many times when she was asleep. So we decided right then and there after losing our third Mr Spittle that we are going to make our own all natural dog treats that are chocolate but have the chemical that makes chocolate poisonous to dogs taken out. We’ve been testing on a group of shelter dogs we adopted and have only had a couple of mishaps. Donate and help us hit our doggie goal. Let this Mr Spittle live!

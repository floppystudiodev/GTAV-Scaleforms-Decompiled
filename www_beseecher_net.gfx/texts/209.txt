I really want to get a tattoo, but I can’t afford one. If you fund my tattoo, I’ll get a portrait, of you. Imagine that - your very own living breathing art gallery. I don’t have any tattoos, apart from some barbed wire, a really embarrassing dude tramp stamp and a swastika I got to prove how uptight people were. Anyway, now I want a really big tattoo - of your face on my back. Think about it. It would be really funny/crazy in a good way. Then we’d be friends for life.

I’ve shot a movie called Mother of the Century. It’s a loving, touching film I shot of my mother getting pounded by the well endowed gardener. I need to raise $1000 so that it can be edited and also for the subtitles because he was screaming stuff in Spanish while they were doing it. I’m just so glad to see my mom happy after my dad left her for cutting him in his sleep. Sometimes I dream I’m in prison having a shower where the guards are all hermaphrodites, I then wake up and feel funny.

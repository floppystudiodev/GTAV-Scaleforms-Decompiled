Follow the journey of Jane Vixen, a young, innocent, religious woman who works at a hobby shop when charming millionaire Lesant Diangelo enters the store to buy supplies for a fleet of remote control devices he is building. Seeing she is intrigued, he offers to show his studio workshop to her after work. On the ride in his supple sports car, he talks about all his work feeding poor crippled children around the globe.When he shows her his workshop she is aghast. He has hooked dildos up to a reciprocating saw, a remote control helicopter, ceiling fan, jackhammer, plunger, toy train and a tank. Plus, there are areas for whips, chains, knives, golden showers, and scat play. Then things get hot and rapey. At the end of 300 pages of depravity, debauchery and lavish gifts charged to a Fleeca Black card, Jane breaks up with Lesant and moves back in with her parents.

Today, if your child doesn’t stand out - not only will they be a failure, but everyone will look on you in shame.  Nothing says ‘boring’ like a boring kid. After all, a kid is you, only more so, as this is a you that you get to shape from the beginning. A lot has changed in the last five years. Bankers, hipsters and celebrities have pretty much ruined everything for everyone.  The pressure to be unconventional has never been greater. Sending your child out into today’s self-indulgent, self-medicated, self-entitled world with an ordinary name is condemning them to a life of failure and mediocrity. That will make you look awful, too. How many interesting, successful, attractive young people do you know called Mike, Dan or Jeff?  Name your child something like that and they won’t lead the crowd; instead they follow at the back of the crowd, wearing corrective shoes, mumbling with their hand down their pants. Everyone will laugh at their parents, too.

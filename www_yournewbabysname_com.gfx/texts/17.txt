Yesterday’s weird is today’s normal. Names that were unique in 2008 are now a dime a dozen. Elementary school classes are full of little Razors, Zeenobs and Mudzillas. You have to go the extra mile to stand out these days. Make your kid reflect who you are on the inside. Don’t burden your child with the stigma of normality. Give them a ludicrous name, and then raise them to be narcissistic enough to carry it off. Just like you wish you had been.

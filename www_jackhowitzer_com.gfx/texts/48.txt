Hello too all my loyal fans.  I had beeen gone for 2 long and am to be glad to be back. War changes a man and war crimes that I did not commit but went to jail change a man to, so I got changed. Now I type with one hand witch is not because I masturbate while we talk it is because I have a friend who I met that talks to me when things they are tough. His name is Ho Chi Sock and he’s from Vietnam, and he’s a sock but he’s also a good friend. Like when things get tough. My sock gets tougher. I love you. I am really glad that the producers of my show believed in me and want to have camera crews around me all the time.  I can’t lye I like the attention, and I have only hurt a couple bad enough to go the hospital. I like Rufus a lot though Ho Chi doesn’t. He wants me to kill him. I faced a lot of challenges when I was in prison. Some men with funny hats were always trying to get me to worship there God but I told them I only worship one God and that’s America.  We don’t need gun control or taxes or public education. We are a nation of men not laws!  I fort for YOUR FREEDOM NEVER FORGET.Ho Chi wants to use the computr so I willl talk to you soon. Peace and push ups.

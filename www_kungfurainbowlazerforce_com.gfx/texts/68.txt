Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force began as a way to teach kids morality in a world where there aren&apos;t morals anymore. Where pornography is available on a smartphone or Lifeinvader tablet. Pictures of nakedness poison the minds of children. It results in widespread hooliganism, banditry, idolatry, early onset dementia and unwillingness to honor thy father and mother.

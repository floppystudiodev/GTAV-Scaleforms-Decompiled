Every time you pull the trigger the gun not only hurtles a 50 caliber round towards any evildoer in your way, but it also plays one of twenty prerecorded lines as comic relief to lighten the moment. If you've just splattered the brains of an illegal immigrant across the pavement, you can't help but burst into laughter when it says "Goddamnit, Dick!  Croissants are for queers!" And when others see you laughing maniacally over a guy who just got shot, they will be sure to steer clear of you, believe it.

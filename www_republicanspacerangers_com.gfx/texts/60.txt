He was made for the Rangers. Born with a gun in his mouth, (he preferred it to a pacifier) and often rocks himself to sleep with his lips wrapped around the business end of a high caliber peace maker. His father and mother are very proud of his illustrious career and named him simply "The Commander" as a child when he showed such prowess at sneaking up on neighborhood kids, braining them, and then formed a tiny army and would lead raids on uppity neighborhoods nearby. Loves Toast and Tits, a topless diner near his home.

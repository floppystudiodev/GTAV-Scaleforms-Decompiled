Butch entered the Space Rangers after several schoolteachers suggested it would fit his violent fits of rage. Butch is fascinated by astrology and will only date women who are Pisces, mostly because he loves all you can eat seafood night at his local chain restaurant. He has served in the Rangers for 12 seasons and was replaced for a brief period during a domestic violence incident in which his ex-girlfriend who was a pro-wrestler put him in the hospital.

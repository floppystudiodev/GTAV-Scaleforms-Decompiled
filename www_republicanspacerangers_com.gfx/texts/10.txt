Oh I'm a Space Ranger!A Ranger tough and strong.  On my honor, I will do my best And never try to get alongOh I'm a Space Ranger!Behold the end of my gunYou better learn God speaks EnglishYour pathetic culture we shunOh I'm a Space Ranger!For God and Country I'll dieI pay no attention to human rightsLaws and rules just don't applyOh I'm a Space Ranger!Keeping the universe safe from youGay sex is an abominationBut two hot lesbians will always do!

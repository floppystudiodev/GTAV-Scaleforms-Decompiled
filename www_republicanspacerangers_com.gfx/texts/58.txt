A classic man of letters, mostly the ones that spell out profanity, Dick keeps the Rangers on the straight and narrow. Raised on a farm, he found that he enjoyed wringing the life out of things that could then be slow cooked with a braised BBQ sauce. He has BBQ'd over 16 different species of alien and is always on the hunt for new and interesting life forms to cook.

Vinewood is run by elitist liberals who use the nation’s airwaves to propagandize the public and make the country weak.  Finally America has some heroes who know there are bigger issues than fretting about baby seals or endangered lizards or so called global warming.   Talking of seals, they are like Navy Seals, but in space. They crawl out of the mirror black ocean of space and slit an alien's throat before he can scream. That's what keeps America safe.  We can slit aliens’ throats before they scream and everyone knows it.

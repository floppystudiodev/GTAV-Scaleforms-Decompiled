At San Andreas Water and Power, we take H2O very seriously. Which is why we are working with state and federal officials to build a pipeline from the Canadian lakes to bring that cool, clear, refreshing water to the tap in your home. It’s not a question of if, it’s when. And if the Canadians dare to say no? Well, let’s just say, they can’t. This continent is called North America. Not North Canada.Write to your Congressman and tell them that our state deserves the water that is by rights, ours.

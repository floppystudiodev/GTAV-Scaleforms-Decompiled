A visit to a Swallow store is a sensory overload.Imagine a dark crowded house party where every room is full of sweatshirts. An army of oiled-up Aryan metrosexuals blocks the doorway. Mainstream alternative rock-pop is blasting at 100 decibels. Surfboards, fake palm trees and projections of Los Santos beach scenes convince you that, just for a second, perhaps you're not in a Midwest strip mall. Pitch-black lighting hides the acne and the creepy old men hanging around the changing rooms.You won't be able to breathe, hear what anyone's saying or see what you're buying, but it doesn't matter because 90% of our inventory consists of the same style of t-shirt and skinny jeans mass-produced in a hundred different colors.

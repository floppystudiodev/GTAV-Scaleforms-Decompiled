Being a teenage boy is a confusing time. You need an identity. Swallow is that identity. Meet Aynsley. He’s too young to have body hair but, even if he did, he’d shave it all off anyway. He wears pink and lavender because he’s secure in his still-developing masculinity. He wakes up each morning and covers himself with organic nut butter. In the summer, blonde streaks appear in his perfectly tousled, spiky hair, but he claims it’s all natural. He wears sunglasses in school, sits on his chair backwards, and carries around a skateboard that he never uses. He drinks espresso, takes guitar lessons, and has already planned out his first three tattoos. He’s fun and impulsive, and once wrestled with his best friend for so long it got weird, but they’re both cool with it now. He’s a rebel but still loves his mom, a little bit too much. He can have long conversations about moisturizing, and claims to volunteer at animal shelters. He has a closet full of Swallow. He offers to listen to girls' problems, and gives them massages.  He’s Aynsley. He’s a Swallow boy, and every girl in school wants to sleep with him. Thanks to the self confidence he has from wearing Swallow, he’s getting straight As and has a full scholarship to college. He’s going to have a great life.

OMG. Other girls are turning into bulimic cutters, riddled in self loathing - but not Aynsley. She eats sushi, does yoga and has a piercing her parents don’t know about. Her friend’s dad is obsessed with her. She's already dating, but nothing serious. She wants to play the field, not because she’s a slut, but because she knows that life’s too short to tie yourself down. She’s too cool to be a cheerleader but isn’t afraid to dress like one. She doesn’t worry about being popular. She just is. She pretends to be drunk at parties. She thinks teen pop idols like Billy and Bobby Blue are lame and would rather listen to classic music from the late 90s. She knows we’re not going to change the world so doesn't worry about it. She changes her Lifeinvader profile picture twenty times a day and says OH MY GOD way too much but she can still laugh at herself because she laughs at almost everything. She has a closet full of Swallow clothing that makes her look so hot, a really rich guy is going to propose, she’ll have 2 darling kids, and live in a huge mansion. All because of Swallow.  She’s Aynsley, and she’s a Swallow girl. Thanks to the self confidence she has from wearing Swallow, she’s getting straight As and has a full scholarship to college. She’s going to have a great life.

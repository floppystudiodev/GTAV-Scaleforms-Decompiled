Hi - we’ve dug up a treasure trove of information about your family - but unfortunately it’s so mind numbingly boring  it’s not really worth talking about. I mean, do you really care that you had family in the Mid-west that raised cows? Or family from the countryside of England where they pray to rocks with scratches on them? Yours is probably the most boring profile we’ve dug up all day. If you’re not a librarian, perhaps you should become one.

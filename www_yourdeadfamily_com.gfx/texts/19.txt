A doctor on your mother’s side was noted for early work towards a cure for the polio virus. After working with children for years, it was soon discovered that he wasn’t working towards a cure, but instead had the children working in servitude, cooking, cleaning and putting on funny plays in his great room. He was set on fire in the town square. Fortunately he had taken on a lover who gave birth to your great great great great grandmother, who lived in shame, as should you. Your father’s side is even worse.

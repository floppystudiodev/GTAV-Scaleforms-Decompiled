Great news - you were related to Napoleon. The House of Bonaparte was an imperial dynasty - and when Charles Bonaparte and his wife gave birth to Louis, he married a woman named Hortense. Hortense was well known to have multiple personalities and was actually a cross dresser. Ashamed, the family found a peasant woman to take her place, and your bloodline would have ended in an asylum except for a fantastic orgy of French lunatics in which your great great great grandmother was spawned.  Youâ€™ve done well, considering.

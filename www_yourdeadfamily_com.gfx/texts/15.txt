Don’t you think it’s a bit unhealthy to have such an obsession over old people - to the point that you’re sexually obsessed with geriatrics and people near death? Old people smell funny. Youth is where it’s at. Stop poking around old age homes for a distant cousin so you can participate in a freaky incest fantasy, instead get a hobby like alcoholism or cricket. Move forward.

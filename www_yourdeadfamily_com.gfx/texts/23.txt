Your great great great great grandfather, Henry Davis Doner, was born in Ireland, and, a widower at the age of 72 took a new wife - who was 22. He coined the phrase “A man is virile forever, while a woman dries like dust and weaves yarn”. You can be proud that you come from a long line of men who love younger women.

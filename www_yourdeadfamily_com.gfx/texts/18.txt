It is said a family tree can wither if nobody tends to its roots. It has also been said that discovering a cousin a day keeps the boredom away, but that’s the kind of thinking you’d expect from dumb interbreeding Southern yokels - which is precisely where your family is from. Your mom never told you about your true Southern roots, instead doing her best to cover up the deep, dirty shame that your parents are cousins, like their parents before them, which sort of explains things. Sorry.

Sunday mornings were always special to your great great Uncle Briggs. He was known throughout his quant New England village as Bridgette, as he would dress up and attend church as a woman, fanning himself and making eyes at married men. Several men took him up on illicit meetings in the bushes behind the church.  Fortunately for you he had a brother that wasn’t a pervert and fathered some normal children that can be traced to your mom’s side of the family.

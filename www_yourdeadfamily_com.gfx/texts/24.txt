Your great grandfather, William Jonathan Daniels, was the captain of a wagon train heading west which was ambushed by Indians in 1855. He was taken captive, beaten and dragged back to the Indian camp, held in a teepee. The daughter of the chief entered the sweltering teepee and slowly undressed him, tending to his wounds.  He eyed her heaving bosom but looked away. She moved closer and lifted her buffalo skin skirt and straddled his throbbing… um, wait a minute… sorry, got carried away. Anyway, you’ve got Indian blood.

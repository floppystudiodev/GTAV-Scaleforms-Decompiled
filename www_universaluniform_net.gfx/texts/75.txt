Before you say it... Yes, we know theyâ€™re horribly over-priced. What do you want from us? They&apos;re made in America! We don&apos;t exploit children in the third world. We exploit them right here, the Los Santos way. By luring them to sex parties with lecherous older men in Vinewood mansions, drugging them up, filming them in states of undress, then using their photos to sell our products.Oh come on, they love it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

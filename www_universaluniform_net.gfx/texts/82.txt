Our CEO is such a visionary free-thinker, he has sex with all the staff. A billboard with a grainy close-in crotch shot of an undeveloped girl in a pair of sheer neon tights isn’t demeaning or misogynistic, neither is a storefront window display with a faceless female mannequin in leg warmers getting gangbanged by a group of male mannequins in brightly-colored hoodies. It sends a positive, empowering message to young women that we understand your generation, that a liberal feminist can still be a slut, and that even dirty girls need clean clothes. Submissive social responsibility, that’s what we’re about. No boundaries. Grab your tits. You’re American. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

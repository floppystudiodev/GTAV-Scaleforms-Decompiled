Our clothing is made in America. We believe that our clothing is sexy - as are the American workers making them, which is why we so often have sexual harassment lawsuits filed against us. And more importantly, our advertising is made in America because that&apos;s what America makes best - a dream you can never fulfill. Wear it.

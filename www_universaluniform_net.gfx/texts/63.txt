We&apos;re about to go bankrupt but we don’t care. No, really, we’re not being deliberately blasé this time. Even though we&apos;re a publicly-traded company, we hate Corporate America. We have a lot of critics, including anti-American feminists who would rather buy their clothes from China than a company that has made it selling a dream - and that dream is slack. Sex and slacking.

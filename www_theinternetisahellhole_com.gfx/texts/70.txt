TV raised Generation X and Y to be well rounded members of society. It&apos;s a generation that understands the social contract of free quality programming - watching a few commercials and supporting the sponsors. The Internet, on the other hand, is raising this new generation to be narcissistic lonely exhibitionists who live in electronic despair, crying out for attention at every waking moment, twitching to check devices twice a minute, rudely ignoring those around them, sexting, and hating others simply because they own the wrong kind of phone.How can you keep your teenager from posting crotch shots? Dating a 40 year old? Posting foul things that will get them in trouble? We&apos;ve developed an online tool, sponsored by Parents Require Intelligent Communicative Kids, which is itself sponsored by a coalition of national broadcasting companies who want your kids to be safe - where you can see them - in front of the television. Just like when you were younger. And look how well you turned out.

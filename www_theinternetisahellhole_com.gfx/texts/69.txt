You remember sitting in front of the TV as a kid - watching a magical world where every kind of problem was solved within an hour. Families were funny and sometimes had pet aliens or two parents of the same sex but were all heterosexual. Cars and trees talked. No one was gay, or took drugs and minorities were cute.All was perfect in the world.

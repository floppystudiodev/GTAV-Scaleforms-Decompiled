Remember - a smart teen is a safe teen and a safe teen is a TV teen. Television is the safest entertainment choice available. Freedom is great, and everything, but sometimes the best choice is to let other people make choices for you. With the exciting next season lineup on the networks, there really is no reason to spend another night trolling Lifeinvader or reading blogs. Tune out the Internet - and Tune into TV. Let&apos;s get America back where it belongs. On the couch.

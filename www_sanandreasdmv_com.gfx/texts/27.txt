In response to an independent survey of the DMV examination centers that deemed them "more filthy, corrupt and crowded than an Indonesian prison", the written portion of the San Andreas driving test can now be completed online. We’re terribly sorry for hiring the underprivileged and those scarred by war or house fires. &nbsp;It’s terrible that people less fortunate than you are such an inconvenience. Please, take the test online, by all means.

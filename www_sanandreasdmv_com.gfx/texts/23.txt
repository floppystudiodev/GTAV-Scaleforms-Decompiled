On average, Los Santos residents spend 7 hours a day sitting in traffic and another 6 hours a day complaining about sitting in traffic. &nbsp;Driving is an inescapable part of Los Santos life, as quintessentially San Andrean as showing up to work at 11:30 am, going for a 3 hour lunch, and wrapping up at 5pm to hit cocktail hour, before an enjoyable evening spent swinging with your equally lost neighbors. It’s this daily cycle of not working very hard and sitting in traffic that results in our state leading the country in therapy, eating disorders, and the desperate pursuit of attention from anyone.It is simply impossible to survive in this state without a car. Walking is considered to be a sign of weakness, poverty or insanity. And public transport? What do you think this is? A modern urban metropolis? Wrong! It’s a post-modern hell hole in which only the rich and stupid are venerated. San Andreas car culture plays by its own rules. If you have a driving license from another state or country, forget everything you’ve learned. This is the land of aggression, drunk driving, and police chases. It is a jungle. Hot, dense, dangerous and full of rabid poor people who will chew your face off just for looking at them the wrong way. &nbsp;&nbsp;

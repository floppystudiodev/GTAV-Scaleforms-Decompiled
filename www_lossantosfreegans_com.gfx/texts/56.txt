Food doesn’t “expire”. What a load of nonsense. Think about blue cheese. Americans lived for thousands of years without refrigerators. Expiration dates are just another method of mind control by the capitalist hegemony.Don’t be a slave to the culture of fear. Live a little. Roll the gastric dice. Our motto is “No mold, you’re gold. A little mold, scrape it off.”

Why crash diet when we can trash diet? Imagine if your food bill was zero - you’d have a lot more money for drugs, beer and cigarettes, believe you me. Why work when you can pilfer everything you need from the people who do work? It’s like choosing to give up buying cigarettes, rather than giving up cigarettes.It’s a cause that everyone can respect.You can find everything you need to survive in a garbage can. Flea-infested clothes, bedbug-ridden furniture, credit cards and, most of all, perfectly good food… if you ignore the fact that it’s been sitting unrefrigerated in cockroaches and toxic bacterial sludge. There’s nothing more exhilarating than rooting through a dumpster in the middle of the night, knowing at any moment a major artery could get sliced by a shard of broken glass or punctured by a diseased hypodermic needle. The explosion of spores as you pluck a half-eaten tomato out of a diaper… The explosion of diarrhea later that night as the pathogens devastate your lower intestine… That’s how you save the world and strengthen your immune system at the same time.

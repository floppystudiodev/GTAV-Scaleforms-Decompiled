Next time you wake up to the clatter of trashcan lids and angrily fire a blind warning shot into the darkness, be aware that you might hit more than a raccoon. Because there’s a new breed of urban scavenger terrorizing the night. White, red-eyed, matted long hair… the Freegan.We’re the Los Santos Freegans. We’re on a crusade to not participate in a consumerist, profit-driven economy (except for buying booze). We don’t keep up with the Joneses. We eat the Joneses’ trash. We’re reducing landfill one mouthful at a time and saving the planet from people like you. &nbsp;Dumpster diving used to be a last resort for the desperate and destitute. For us, it’s a lifestyle choice and political statement. We don’t need to live on garbage. We’re college graduates from good middle class families.No, we’re non-productive members of society by choice.Even the homeless hate us.By drinking curdled milk and making moldy casseroles, our mission is to strike a blow against capitalism by plundering the stuff that capitalists throw away. We loot food from supermarket dumpsters then organize protests outside those supermarkets for wasting food. We oppose social injustice by foraging the food homeless people used to survive on and serving it at bohemian dinner parties in artists’ lofts. In short, we despise the system that creates the food we rob, so we buck it by living outside it, yet within it. It’s confusing, we’re too stoned to deal with it right now, and this stolen wifi connection is like 1990s slow. Suffice to say, our ideology isn’t perfect, and neither are we, but it feels enough like radical environmentalism to tide us over until we come up with something less pointless.

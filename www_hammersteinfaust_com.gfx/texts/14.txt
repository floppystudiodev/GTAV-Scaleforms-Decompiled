Workers face an uphill battle in today&apos;s rough economic climate. &nbsp;With massive unemployment you’ve got to get what you’re owed while you can. Employers are willing to take unfair advantage of your talents while the executive crooks make off with all the profits. That&apos;s like slavery.And thanks to popular plebiscite it&apos;s entirely illegal in our state.We can ensure that you&apos;ll never need to work again. In the eyes of the law, your boss is a thief, a bully and a pervert until proven innocent, which rarely happens. It is almost impossible to sack someone these days. The employee is king. If you’re willing to get creative, the rewards can be endless. &nbsp;We’ll help you fall in the break room, then file for worker’s compensation, then take some time off for stress, then sue for being passed over for promotion, then take the severance package when you’re sacked for doing no work of any value, then file an unfair dismissal claim, then continue to get paid while you look for another job. The gravy train stops at every station. &nbsp;Have great tits? Even if you don&apos;t, a sexual harassment claim is a great way to get back at your old company while securing your financial future. We can bet at least one fellow employee has looked at your breasts and thought about &nbsp;a passionate face plant. And if you are a male worker you can claim harassment too. Just find a strong female in the office and blame her.Courts love this stuff!

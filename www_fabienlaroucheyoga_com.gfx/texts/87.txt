After growing up in the only small town in France where people didn’t understand that a man can be both flamboyantly camp and fiercely heterosexual at the same time, in 1999 Fabien moved to the one place where he knew that he’d definitely fit in: San Fierro. Then, following some unfortunate charges that were never proven, he moved to Los Santos. &nbsp;Following a sustained period of personal crisis and poor decisions, he credits yoga with saving him from himself in 2002. He hasn’t looked back since, except in the Wheel pose. He studied under the great Chidaatma Shashikanth via audio book and spent three months in solitude (except for social media and coffee runs) at the beginning of 2009 learning how to feed himself individual blades of grass with his toes. He is able to touch any part of his body with any other part of his body and could be sexually self-sufficient if he wanted to, but never would be because he cares too much about the sharing of the human spirit.He has never lost sight of the infinite potential of an ancient Indian spiritual art that is re-branded as a health fad for neurotic white yuppies. He speaks French, English with a patronizing French accent, and atrocious, bastardized Sanskrit. &nbsp;

Fabien provides one-on-one classes so that he can connect with his students on a more profound and intimate level. &nbsp;He believes that personal space is a negative force that blocks access to the aura so takes a hands-on, uninhibited approach to instruction.His interdisciplinary training techniques blend traditional yoga with expressionist dance, experimental mime, and frequent proselytizing on the benefits of a dairy-free, vegan diet. &nbsp;He ends each session with a hug and a verse of original poetry. &nbsp;

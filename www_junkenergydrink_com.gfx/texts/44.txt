We have rooms full of advertising wonks whose only job is to come up with these slogans, because we are passionate about the under-25 demographic and their reckless lifestyle. You’re the social media generation. You don’t work hard but you play hard. You care about self expression but have no idea what it means.You take pictures of your junk and you drink Junk. You mix energy drinks that have the consistency of rocket fuel with vodka, then dance half the night and take home some chick that’s a 4 out of 10 and give her a Junk-fueled pounding.

Junk is packed full of hundreds of performance-enhancing chemicals that sound totally badass, like glucuronolactone, maltodextrin, pyridoxine, sodium benzoate, bull sperm and acetylcysteine. This shit is made in a laboratory. And not a reputable one. We test this on animals and know we have the perfect formula by dialing back slightly from anything that makes a dog’s heart implode.  Don’t be fooled by the names - these are 100% all-natural and safe for children and pregnant teenagers and people with heart conditions*.  Junk - the healthy alternative to soda. A drink so awesome, you can never get hydrated enough.

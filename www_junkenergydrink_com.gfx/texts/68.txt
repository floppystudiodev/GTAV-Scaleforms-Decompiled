Just because every bar in the country now has a 6-foot inflatable can of Junk hanging above it, and there’s a team of hot girls in Junk bikinis handing out free samples outside every nightclub, in no way does that mean that we condone the mixing of Junk with alcohol for its reported amazing euphoric effects. We would also like to draw attention to the ecstatic high reportedly caused by mixing Junk with cough medicine and/or muscle relaxants, not to put ideas in people’s heads, but to make them aware of the dangers of such a cheap and easily accessible combination that can result in an amazing weekend of impossible-to-beat fun.

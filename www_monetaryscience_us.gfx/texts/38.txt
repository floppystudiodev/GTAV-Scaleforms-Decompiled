Do you want to be a post-apocalyptic  millionaire?  While your neighbors are resorting to cannibalism, do you want to be living the good life or having to eat your children in order to survive? You're only a few gold bars away from being the king of the apocalypse, my friend - with your choice of all the women, wine and food that makes it through the end of days. Seriously, when things go down, women flock to the man on top of the hill with the shiny shit, no matter how fat, balding or boring he is. Pandemics. Natural disasters. Nuclear fallout. Bioterrorism. Modern civilization is certainly on the brink of collapse. Are you ready? You don't want your wealth sitting in a bank account gathering interest or your financial risk spread across a diversified portfolio of investments.  That's lunacy. The honeybees have gone silent. Bats are dying at a record pace. Pop music has gotten worse since I was young. It's started. The end times. Cash in your 401k today and put all of your life's savings into Gold, Cesium, Silver, Platinum, Tin, Francium, Aluminum, Lead and Palladium. In the event of major financial collapse, we are pretty sure that these commodities will become the default currency, just like they were before, like for Incas and people in Medieval things, like RPGs. Precious metals earn no interest and have no inherent value, but they're Armageddon proof. Plus, when you whip out a gold bar and rub it on your lady, she is going to know who is the king of your shit heap, that's for sure.
